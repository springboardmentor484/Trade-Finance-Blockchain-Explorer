step1:
    Buyer(corporate user) creates a PO from UI. Gives the seller, currency, amount

    System:
        1. creates a document (d1) PO, 
        2. creates a transaction(tx1) with seller, buyer, currency, amount
            tx1 (status = pending)
        3. creates a ledger(l1) for d1 with 
            metadata transaction_id: tx1
            status = 'ISSUED'


Step2:
    Bank checks PO and issues a LOC
    Opens a PO in the UI and performs issue action in PO

    System:
        1. creates a document (d2) LOC
        2. creates a ledger (l2) for d2. 
            status = 'ISSUED'
            metadata (transaction_id: tx1 (from d1), po_id: d1,  )


Step3:
    Auditor reviews PO, LOC
    When Auditor opens a PO, we can point display the LOC's details also
    performs the verified action

    System:
        1. create ledger entry for PO(d1) l3, metadata=tx_id, action='VERIFIED'
        2. create ledger entry for LOC(d2) l4, metadata=tx_id, action='VERIFIED'
        3. update the transaction status tx1 = in_progress
    
Step4:
    Seller uploads a BOL(Bill of Landing) for a transaction (which is in_progress)

    System:
        1. create a document BOL (d3) ,owner_id=Seller
        2. create a ledger (l5), status = 'SHIPPED', metadata(tx_id, tracking_id: 123)

Step5:
    Seller issues a INVOICE (d4) for a transaction

    System:
        1. create a document  INVOICE
        2. create a ledger action='ISSUED', meta (tx_id, )

Step6:
    Buyer receives the package and marks the BOL as received

    System:
        1. create a ledger (l6) for BOL(d3), status='RECEIVED'  ,meta(tx_id)

Step7:
    Bank pays the INVOICE(d4)
    performs "PAY" action on the invoice

    System:
        1. create a ledger(l7) with status = "PAID"
        2. update transaction status = 'completed'



tx1 = [ l1, l2, l3, l4, l5, l6, l7 ]
